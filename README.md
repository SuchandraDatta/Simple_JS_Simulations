3.**Simulating the foobar challenge**

Tried to make a simplistic simulation of the foobar coding challenge. HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla js used for designing the terminal like frontend. List of commands is shown. The up and down arrow keys can be used for going through the previous commands keyed in, much like what happens in a real terminal. After all questions listed are solved, they are submitted via file upload.
A Node express app is set up. The file uploaded is got hold of using multer middleware. A copy of the file is made server side. Using child-process module, a new process is spawned that's used to execute the file via Python. The output of the program is got and compared in Nodejs to the solutions. Program outputs and solutions kept simple but will be changed appropriately later. Depending on output, scores are given and saved in a file.

Ofcourse this is just for purpose of practicing stuff in a fun way. No idea what the real foobar challenge looks like.
